## Description: Brief description of the project and its purpose
 Example: “A data analysis project for Metro Good, conducted as part of the STC 6-Week Data Analyst Mentorship. The project includes data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and actionable recommendations.”

## Project Description
Explain the project’s scope and approach.
Example: “The project covers data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and recommendations to address specific business questions identified in Week 1.”

## Project Aim
The main objective of this project is to analyze medical records collected internally from the hospital between 2011 and 2022 to provide solutions that guide better decision-making thus answering key business questions such as:
•	What are the total and average hospital costs by year and procedure type?
•	What are the top 5 most expensive procedures and encounters?
•	What is the average length of stay per procedure and encounter?
•	What encounter and procedure is causing the longest stay?
•	How does the average length of stay vary across encounters and age groups?
•	Which year recorded the highest claim and base costs by procedure and encounter?
•	Is there a relationship between encounter length of stay (LOS) and total claim cost?
•	Which payer has the highest insurance coverage?
•	Number of insured patients and uninsured patients
•	Number of patients readmitted
•	What is the readmission rate?

## About the Dataset
Document dataset details:
Source (e.g., company database, Kaggle)

The datasets were imported as a CSV file into Excel. Duplicate copy was created for each before launching Power Query for transformation.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
Steps taken to clean and prepare the data:
Removed duplicates
Fixed missing values
Standardized column names
Changed data types

## Data Modeling (if applicable)
Document any calculated fields, DAX measures, or relationships in Power BI/Excel Power Pivot.

## Key Insights
* Myocardial Infarction and Prenatal Initial Visit had the highest total claim costs, while “Admit to ICU” incurred the highest base cost.
* Periodic reevaluation and management of healthy individuals had the longest encounter durations, while Renal Dialysis dominated in procedure-level length of stay.
* Patients aged 18–34 had the longest average stay, indicating higher hospitalization or treatment needs among younger adults.
* Total and base claim costs fluctuated over the years, with noticeable peaks around 2015 and slight declines afterward.
* Longer stays are associated with higher total claim costs, though most encounters are of short duration.
* Medicare recorded the highest insurance coverage among payers.

## Recommendations
Stakeholder: Hospital Management (Medical Director)
Recommendation: Review cost structures for these high-cost procedures to identify opportunities for cost optimization, better resource allocation, and preventive strategies that can reduce expensive admissions

Stakeholder: Clinical and Medical Teams
Recommendation: Streamline evaluation processes and dialysis scheduling to improve patient flow, reduce waiting time, and optimize bed utilization.

Stakeholder: Health Information Officers & Clinical Teams
Recommendation: Investigate causes of longer stays (e.g., lifestyle, chronic conditions) and implement targeted wellness or preventive health programs for younger adults.

Stakeholder: Hospital Management & Health Insurance Providers
Recommendation: Analyze cost fluctuations to uncover root causes (policy changes, resource use, patient load) and implement strategies for stable budgeting and claim management.

Stakeholder: Hospital Management & Clinical Teams
Recommendation: Adopt early discharge planning, reinforce post-discharge monitoring, and implement case management systems to reduce avoidable prolonged stays.

Stakeholder: Hospital Management & Health Insurance Providers
Recommendation: Strengthen partnerships with Medicare while also engaging other insurers to expand patient access and diversify revenue.

## **Conclusion**
Summarize findings and the potential impact on business decisions:
Example: “Insights from sales and customer data provide guidance for inventory, marketing, and product strategies to maximize revenue.”
