## Key Insights
* Myocardial Infarction and Prenatal Initial Visit had the highest total claim costs, while “Admit to ICU” incurred the highest base cost.
* Periodic reevaluation and management of healthy individuals had the longest encounter durations, while Renal Dialysis dominated in procedure-level length of stay.
* Patients aged 18–34 had the longest average stay, indicating higher hospitalization or treatment needs among younger adults.
* Total and base claim costs fluctuated over the years, with noticeable peaks around 2015 and slight declines afterward.
* Longer stays are associated with higher total claim costs, though most encounters are of short duration.
* Medicare recorded the highest insurance coverage among payers.

## Recommendations
Stakeholder: Hospital Management (Medical Director)
Recommendation: Review cost structures for these high-cost procedures to identify opportunities for cost optimization, better resource allocation, and preventive strategies that can reduce expensive admissions

Stakeholder: Clinical and Medical Teams
Recommendation: Streamline evaluation processes and dialysis scheduling to improve patient flow, reduce waiting time, and optimize bed utilization.

Stakeholder: Health Information Officers & Clinical Teams
Recommendation: Investigate causes of longer stays (e.g., lifestyle, chronic conditions) and implement targeted wellness or preventive health programs for younger adults.

Stakeholder: Hospital Management & Health Insurance Providers
Recommendation: Analyze cost fluctuations to uncover root causes (policy changes, resource use, patient load) and implement strategies for stable budgeting and claim management.

Stakeholder: Hospital Management & Clinical Teams
Recommendation: Adopt early discharge planning, reinforce post-discharge monitoring, and implement case management systems to reduce avoidable prolonged stays.

Stakeholder: Hospital Management & Health Insurance Providers
Recommendation: Strengthen partnerships with Medicare while also engaging other insurers to expand patient access and diversify revenue.
