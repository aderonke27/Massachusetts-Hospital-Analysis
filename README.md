## **Insights from the Data Analysis**

### 🔹 Insight 1

**Finding:** Myocardial Infarction and Prenatal Initial Visit had the highest total claim costs, while “Admit to ICU” incurred the highest base cost.
**Recommendation:** Review cost structures for these high-cost procedures to identify opportunities for cost optimization, better resource allocation, and preventive strategies that can reduce expensive admissions.
**Stakeholder:** Hospital Management (Medical Director)

---

### 🔹 Insight 2

**Finding:** Periodic reevaluation and management of healthy individuals had the longest encounter durations, while Renal Dialysis dominated in procedure-level length of stay.
**Recommendation:** Streamline evaluation processes and dialysis scheduling to improve patient flow, reduce waiting time, and optimize bed utilization.
**Stakeholder:** Clinical and Medical Teams

---

### 🔹 Insight 3

**Finding:** Patients aged 18–34 had the longest average stay, indicating higher hospitalization or treatment needs among younger adults.
**Recommendation:** Investigate causes of longer stays (e.g., lifestyle, chronic conditions) and implement targeted wellness or preventive health programs for younger adults.
**Stakeholder:** Health Information Officers & Clinical Teams

---

### 🔹 Insight 4

**Finding:** Total and base claim costs fluctuated over the years, with noticeable peaks around 2015 and slight declines afterward.
**Recommendation:** Analyze cost fluctuations to uncover root causes (policy changes, resource use, patient load) and implement strategies for stable budgeting and claim management.
**Stakeholder:** Hospital Management & Health Insurance Providers

### 🔹 Insight 5

**Finding:** Longer stays are associated with higher total claim costs, though most encounters are of short duration.
**Recommendation:** Adopt early discharge planning, reinforce post-discharge monitoring, and implement case management systems to reduce avoidable prolonged stays.
**Stakeholder:** Hospital Management & Clinical Teams
